# Day 3 - Oracles, ERC20 tokens and Chainlink Data Feeds

### ORACLE PROBLEM DEFINITION
The blockchain oracle problem refers to the inability of blockchains to access external data, making them isolated networks, akin to a computer with no Internet connection. Bridging the connection between the blockchain (onchain) and the outside world (offchain) requires an additional piece of infrastructureâ€”an oracle.

## Activities

- To know the tonken standards: [token standards](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/)
- The ERC20 token standard: [ERC20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/)
- Create, deploy and interact with the smar contract [Token.sol](./Token.sol)
- Add the token on Metamask
- [Chainlink Data Feeds:](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds) Chainlink Data Feeds are the quickest way to connect your smart contracts to the real-world data such as asset prices, reserve balances, NFT floor prices, and L2 sequencer health.
- [Data Feed Sepolia](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=ethereum&page=1#sepolia-testnet) configuration
- Create, deploy and interact with the smart contract [TokenShop.sol](./TokenShop.sol)
